# LearningDutch3000 ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±
This is just something I do to help me nail down in my own head the absolute basics and rules of Dutch grammar. I thought it helps when i translate some concepts into programming as form of practice and absorptionâ„¢. Let's see!

## Note
This is not an actual code repo. It takes form of Javascriptâ„¢ the language we all love but takes some liberty by introducing fantasical methods. Code is index.js. Note also, this was done in a haste so dont murder me if it's all like, omg, the formatting is wrong or you could've used an array or whatever

## P.S.
This will keep on growing as I encounter some more things that I feel like i turn into js function formula. So check back in for entertainment (i certainly will) and I will report back in a year by re-typing this README in Dutch.

## P.P.S.
Since this is just for fun, if you're a native Dutch speaker, please feel free to call me out on wrong things by posting a fantasy :bug: in issues ðŸš¨

Wish me luck! ðŸŒˆ
